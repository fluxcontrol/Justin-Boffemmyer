CURRENT PROBLEMS/BUGS:
	sys build fails
		1) libmpc
			bug in INSTALL (symlink -s instead of symlink -sf)
			fixed in test; fixed in stable v. ??? (forthcoming)
		2) util-linux
			bug in PREPARE (erroneous and outdated query concerning /dev/ttyN)
			fixed in test; fixed in stable v. ??? (forthcoming)
		3) glibc
			bugs all over the place, most notably in overwriting
				the headers from the kernel
			removing any/all code that forcibly installs kernel
				headers fixes the problem
			glibc ALSO seems to need --disable-werror in it's BUILD
				or it will fail in regex.c for an uninitialized
				variable
			not fixed anywhere at present
		Patching/correcting the spell files (either via loadable
		patches or in-situ) fixes the problems and sys build then
		succeeds
	iso build fails
		1) net-tools
			fails in PREPARE because of the warning that defaults to bailing out
				this is for (*really*) old setups that no one
				should have anymore, especially not
				newly-installed systems, so the warning doesn't
				apply and could be removed, or at least default
				to not bailing out
			not fixed anywhere at present
			not needed in the iso runtime due to using busybox
			STILL NEEDED as an installable cache for other spells
		2) pciutils
			completely unknown cause for failure in BUILD on first
				run (perhaps a missing dependency?)
			success on second cast with no change otherwise
			NOT NEEDED ANYMORE THANKS TO USING lshw INSTEAD
		3) cryptsetup-luks source is missing (1.6.6)
			no idea about cryptmount, but removed both from the iso
			spell lists (iso.caches and iso.spells) for the time
			being

convert spell list files to array vars
	make a base/default CAULDRON_ISO_SOURCES=( ... ) in config/iso.conf
	have an arch-specific arch/x86/iso.conf that defines
		CAULDRON_ISO_SOURCES=( "${CAULDRON_ISO_SOURCES[@]}" ... ) to
		add any arch-specific sources to the list
	no more need for etc/<arch>/iso.sources and friends
	the list can be modified either by editing the config file or by
		setting env vars
	do the same for both <iso> and <sys>

clean up the directory structure usage
	figure out what directories to use for what, when, and where to put all
	the "junk" temporary stuff needed for interim building/setting up of
	toolchains and whatnot

	currently, everything is kind of haphazardly dumped into
	CAULDRON_BUILD, which is probably not where everything belongs. Perhaps
	use a CAULDRON_TMP/tmp? That seems a little redundant/silly, but might
	work. Or CAULDRON_BUILD/tmp perhaps. I suppose ideally CAULDRON_TMP/tmp
	would be better, since a download of sorcery and/or grimoire should be
	usable for build, sys, and iso, so it would be more logical to put it
	in a common dir.

need a metadata/tracking file (or dir of files)
	when cauldron performs operations, we need to track what was performed,
	using what method, and when (at what time).

	this will facilitate smart updates later, so we only need to check when
	the operation was done if it's the same op being requested, and update
	if it's too old or if it's different from the op requested (switch to
	the new op).

	it is also needed for dependency resolution, so we can know if a given
	dependency has been met or not
