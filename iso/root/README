Welcome to the Source Mage Install CD.

We're all about staying out of your way, and this installer is no different.
There's a checklist in /root 
  less /root/checklist

That will provide you with enough information to install your system. If not,
and you had to solicit help from elsewhere, write down what it was you were
missing and get on IRC and tell us about it.

Okay, you're all set! Hopefully your install goes well :D
