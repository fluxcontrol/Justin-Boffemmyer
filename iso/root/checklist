1. Partition disk
 - Use cfdisk if you're a n00b ;) 
 - If you're not a n00b you probably know what to use already
 - There's fdisk and cfdisk at least
 - make at least a few gigs for root, 4 is usually overly safe
   As long as you're going to create additional partitions later
 - Don't forget a swap partition
  - You can make a swapfile if you'd like; noted below :)

2. make the filesystem of your choice
 - mkreiserfs
 - mke2fs
 - mke2fs -j (ext3)

3. mount root partition
 - Example: mount /dev/sda1 /
 - If you didn't create a swap partition, create a swapfile
  - 512mb swapfile: dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=524288
  - Got that count number by (1024 * 512) so if you wanted a 1GB swap
    it'd be 1024 * 1024 for the count; DO THIS AFTER MOUNTING
  - One can do simple math in bash by doing: 
     echo $((1024 * 512))

4. If you like you can swapon the swap or swapfile

5. cd to your freshly mounted root partition and extract the system tarball
 - cd /mnt/root
 - tar -jxvf /system.tar.bz2 .

6. set up the root file system to chroot into
 - mount --bind /dev dev
 - mount --bind /dev/pts dev/pts
 - mount --bind /proc proc

7. chroot into it
 - chroot .

8. install the bootloader of your choice
 - Should probably say yes to installing a default menu.lst (if grub)
   cp /etc/lilo.example.conf /etc/lilo.conf to use lilo
 - edit /etc/lilo.conf and run lilo
 - edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and run grub-install

9. default root password is
                               "sourcemage"

 - Probably wouldn't hurt to change that ;)
 - Nothing is installed by default
 - Available grimoires:
  - scribe add test
  - scribe add z-rejected
  - scribe add games
  - scribe add xorg-modular from http://codex.sourcemage.org/testing/xorg-modular.tar.bz2

A. reboot and make with the casting!
 - Don't forget to run scribe update and sorcery update, just to make sure
   you've got the latest versions of things

B. Don't forget to drop by and see us on #sourcemage on irc.freenode.net
 - for some quick IRC'in cast irssi or weechat
