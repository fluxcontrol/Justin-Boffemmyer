add a manpage
	ward needs some documentation to explain what it is for, what it does,
	and how it does it

find include files dynamically
	rather than hardcode a list of include files to test against, scan for
		sourced files in the target; this will ensure only files
		actually sourced are checked for variable and function
		definitions, and will also enable testing for sourcing
		non-existent files
	this is harder to achieve, as it will require recursively scanning
		variable definitions to determine real paths, and in some cases
		will result in paths that cannot be available before an actual
		run-time instance

add ISO runtime/build tests
	test for all necessary runtime spells
	test for all necessary install caches
	test for all necessary install sources
	test for enchantment and enchantment init environment
		enchantment should be smart about this itself, as long as all
		its files are intact and present in the correct paths
	test for presence and validity of initramfs/ramdisk

add SYS build tests
	test for kernel source availability/location/linking
	test for all necessary runtime spells
	test validity of SYS compiler toolchain
		can be accomplished by compiling a very small program and
		testing its output (for non-crossbuild cases), as well as
		running file on the compiled binary to ensure that it is built
		for the correct architecture
