@[spell-sources step]
You may now select the spell sources you would like to install. You can
accomplish this either using enchantment or editing the file directly. @[NOTE:]
the iso sources are located in /var/spool/sorcery/. It is also highly
recommended that you select at least one bootloader to build later. Bootloaders
must be provided as sources rather than prebuilt caches (packages) because they
come with varying options, some of which (depending on the bootloader at least)
may be self-conflicting.

via text menu:
  @[enchantment select sources] # presents a text menu for toggling sources
  @[enchantment select sources add glob] # adds files matching the pattern
  @[enchantment select sources del glob] # removes files matching the pattern

edit manually:
  @[$EDITOR "$ENCHANT_TMP/spell_sources"]

You can of course use any editor you like, in case you haven't set $EDITOR.

You can re-edit @[$ENCHANT_TMP/spell_sources] any time during the install
session and your changes will be remembered if you have potion functionality
enabled. Likewise, you may always re-run @[enchantment select sources] at any
time.

When you are finished selecting your spell sources, type @[next].
