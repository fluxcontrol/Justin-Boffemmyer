@[spell-caches step]
You may now select the spell caches (built packages) you would like installed
that are provided on the ISO. You can accomplish this either using enchantment
or by directly editing @[$ENCHANT_TMP/spell_caches]. The iso caches available
for installation are present in /var/cache/sorcery/.

enchantment:
  @[enchantment select caches] # presents a text menu for toggling caches
  @[enchantment select caches add glob] # adds files matching the pattern
  @[enchantment select caches del glob] # removes files matching the pattern

manually:
  @[$EDITOR "$ENCHANT_TMP/spell_caches"]

You can of course use any editor you like, in case you haven't set $EDITOR.

You can re-edit @[$ENCHANT_TMP/spell_caches] any time during the install session
and your changes will be remembered if you have potion functionality enabled.
Likewise, you may always re-run @[enchantment select caches] at any time.

When you are finished selecting your spell caches, type @[next].
