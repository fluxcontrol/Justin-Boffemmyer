@[boot-loader step]
Now it is time to set up a boot loader. It is assumed that whichever boot
loader you will set up here was selected and installed during the
@[select-spells] and @[install] steps.

Once you have decided which boot loader to set up, you need to configure the
boot loader. After you finish configuring your boot loader, you need to
"install" it. This involves running the boot loader, which will install itself
to the location you specified in the config file.

For instructions for your bootloader, type @[todo name]
where @[name] is the spell name of your bootloader (e.g. lilo, grub2, etc.).

example: for grub instructions, type @[todo grub].

To see the instructions for this step again, just type @[todo].

When you are finished, type @[next].
