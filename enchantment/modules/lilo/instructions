@[lilo step]:
Edit @[$ENCHANT_TARGET/etc/lilo.conf] to fit your setup (especially, you'll
want to change the boot= and root= entries to point to your partitions, and
you'll need to set the kernel version correctly).

To run lilo properly, you need to chroot into the new system and then install
lilo.

chroot into the installed system:
  @[enchantment chroot]

run lilo so it installs to the boot record:
  @[/sbin/lilo]

exit the chroot:
  @[ exit]

Unless you got an error message when you were installing the boot loader,
you should be done with this step. Type @[next] to go to the next step.
