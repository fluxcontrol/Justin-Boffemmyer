@[edit-confs step]
(For editors available on this iso, type @[list-editors])

Partitions and mounts: @[$ENCHANT_TARGET/etc/fstab]
Edit fstab for your partitions and mounts so your system will find them again
on bootup.

Also, take a look at the files in @[$ENCHANT_TARGET/etc/sysconfig/] and edit any you
feel should be different. Especially, you should make sure the @[facilities] file
looks correct, and if you selected a custom keymap at the start of this
install, you'll need to edit the file called @[keymap] in that directory
(type @[cat /tmp/enchantment/keymap] to see which you chose).

Hostname: @[$ENCHANT_TARGET/etc/hostname]
If you wish to set a hostname for your system, add it here.

Networking: @[/mnt/root/etc/network/interfaces]
Edit this file (@[man interfaces] for help) to set your networking.

Timezone: (replace "SOME/TIMEZONE" with your actual timezone)
  @[enchantment chroot ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/SOME/TIMEZONE /etc/localtime]

Type @[next] to go to the next step.
