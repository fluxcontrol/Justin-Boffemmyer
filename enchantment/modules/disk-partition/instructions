@[disk-partition step]
First, we'll need to create some partitions on your disk that we can install
SMGL to. You'll need to know the device of your hard disk to do this. To find
your disks, you can try @[ls /sys/block], @[cat /proc/partitions], or
@[dmesg | grep -i disk]. You probably want something that starts with either hd
or sd.

Then, use a program to partition your device:

cfdisk, a curses-based menu front-end to fdisk: @[cfdisk /dev/sda]
parted: @[parted /dev/sda]
fdisk: @[fdisk /dev/sda]

There is also @[sfdisk], if you're low-level enough to want to use it.

Be sure to create a swap partition unless you know you don't need one.
Remember to save your new partitioning scheme before quitting the program.

Type @[next] when you're done.
