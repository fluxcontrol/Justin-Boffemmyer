@[disk-mount step]
You need to mount the filesystems you will use. Please be sure to mount your
intended / and all sub-mounts (e.g. /usr) relative to the installer target mount:
   @[$ENCHANT_TARGET] (e.g., mount /usr at @[$ENCHANT_TARGET]/usr)

Examples:
  @[mount -t xfs /dev/sda1 $ENCHANT_TARGET]
  @[mkdir $ENCHANT_TARGET/boot $ENCHANT_TARGET/usr]
  @[mount -t ext2 /dev/sda2 $ENCHANT_TARGET/boot]
  @[mount -t reiserfs /dev/sda3 $ENCHANT_TARGET/usr]
  @[mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 $ENCHANT_TARGET/var]

The above are examples only. Replace them with the partitions and filesystem
types you used in the @[disk-format] step.

Don't forget to mount @[all] the (system) partitions you plan to use under
@[$ENCHANT_TARGET]. Also, you may want to turn on swap via e.g.
  @[swapon /dev/sda5]

Type @[next] to go to the next step.
