@[disk-format step]
Now create filesystems on the partitions you just created. Below is a list
of example commands for different types of filesystems. The partitions given
are examples only. Be sure to format all the partitions you need.

Examples:
  @[mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1]
  @[mke2fs /dev/sda2]
  @[mkreiserfs /dev/sda3]
  @[mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda4]

You probably want a swap partition:
  @[mkswap /dev/sda5]

Type @[next] to go to the next step.
